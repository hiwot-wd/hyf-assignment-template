Instructions
Think of a personal project (could be real, or made up!) to use in this assignment. Maybe you need to put up a new shelf in your apartment? Or you need to bake a cake for your friend's birthday?

Create a new Trello board and fill out a backlog of at least 10 tasks.

Tip: If you can't think of enough tasks, break some bigger ones into smaller ones (e.g. instead of "bake the cake in the oven" it could be split into "preheat the oven to 180 degrees", "bake for 20 minutes", "remove and cool for 15 minutes").

Prioritise each task into Now, Next and Later and order your backlog accordingly.

Share your board's public link as part of submitting this assignment.
